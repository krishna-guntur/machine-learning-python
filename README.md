# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning with Python  

This repository documents my learning journey in **Machine Learning with Python**, focusing on building a strong foundation in ML algorithms, model evaluation, and real-world applications.  

## ðŸ”§ Libraries & Tools  
- **scikit-learn** â†’ Core ML library for supervised & unsupervised algorithms  
- **XGBoost** â†’ Gradient boosting for classification & regression  
- **LightGBM** â†’ Fast and efficient gradient boosting framework  
- **CatBoost** â†’ Gradient boosting optimized for categorical features  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** â†’ (Planned) for deep learning and neural networks  
- *(More libraries and frameworks to be added as I progress!)*  

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Implement core ML algorithms step by step (from scratch & with libraries)  
- Apply ML techniques on real-world datasets (classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, etc.)  
- Build end-to-end ML workflows (EDA â†’ model â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment-ready)  
- Transition gradually into Deep Learning with TensorFlow / PyTorch
